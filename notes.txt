IF YOU HAVE TIME: 

CHANGE RATING TO A NUMBER IN THE DATABASE. 

MAKE BINDING A MULTIPLE CHOICE BETWEEN HARDBACK, PAPERBACK AND NULL RATHER THAN HAVING THE USER TYPE IT MANUALLY.

FIGURE OUT HOW TO ALLOW A USER TO ADD GENRE AND FORMAT

FIND OUT WHY NEW BOOKS SKIP ID 15 WHEN POSTED

MAKE IT SO THAT SUBMITTED BOOKS CAN ACCEPT NULL AS A VALUE IN SOME OF THEM LIKE AUDIOBOOKS NOT HAVING PAGES

the genre part was done with immense help from my friend max

i manhandled the hell out of my database so when i get to class to present make sure i remember to add the format_id to the book table
